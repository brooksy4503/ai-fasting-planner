Avoid repeating the same main ingredients or cooking techniques. Include detailed Mediterranean preparations like Greek-style grilled meats, Italian herb-roasted vegetables, and Spanish tapas-inspired dishes. Tailor portions for: ${finalAnswers.sex}, age ${finalAnswers.age}, height ${finalAnswers.height}, current weight ${finalAnswers.currentWeight}, target weight ${finalAnswers.targetWeight} in ${finalAnswers.timeframe}, activity level: ${finalAnswers.activityLevel}.
