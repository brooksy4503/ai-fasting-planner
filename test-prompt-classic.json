Skip Saturday for 36-hour fast (${finalAnswers.fastingStart} to ${finalAnswers.fastingEnd}). Focus on classic American comfort foods adapted for keto: rich sauces, hearty meats, creamy sides, and familiar flavors using keto-friendly ingredients. ENSURE VARIETY: alternate proteins (ground beef, steak, chicken, pork, fish, eggs), vary cooking methods (bake, grill, pan-sear, slow-cook, air-fry, roast), and change flavor profiles daily (garlic-herb butter, spicy Cajun, tangy barbecue, cheesy comfort, smoky grill, zesty citrus). Include traditional American preparations like meatloaf-style dishes, Southern fried adaptations, New England baked goods, Midwestern comfort classics, and Southwestern spice blends. Avoid repeating the same cuts of meat or cooking techniques.
